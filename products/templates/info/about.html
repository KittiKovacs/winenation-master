            <h2 class="titles">An introduction to the area</h2>
            <p>‘Old world’ wine refers to that from traditional wine-producing regions in western Europe (France, Spain,
                Italy and the like), but in fact wine was first made in countries further east. Georgia lays claim to
                being the birthplace of wine, with archeological evidence of wine-making dating back more than 8,000
                years, and, across the Black Sea, countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovenia have also
                been making wine for millennia.</p>
            <p>What these countries have in common is that they all became communist regimes after World War II. Land
                and wineries were taken over by the state, and many old indigenous grape vines were dug up to be
                replanted with high-yielding international varieties to make vast quantities of poor-quality wine, often
                adulterated with additives.</p>
            <p>After the revolutions of 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when these countries gained
                independence, wineries were privatised and land was returned to its pre-war owners. And, with the
                exception of Georgia, they joined the EU in the early 2000s, which brought a wave of much-needed
                investment to their wine industries. Indigenous grapes were replanted, and the process was modernised
                with an eye to sustainability by cutting back the use of chemicals. Quality drastically improved, and
                now these grapes are reaching the maturity required to produce some excellent wines.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>Independence has brought to these countries a pride in their heritage and culture, and
                wine-making is
                very much part of that. It’s a tradition that’s being revived and reinvented, and its future is
                looking
                rosy.</p>
            <p>These countries have the advantage of lower production and labour costs than in western Europe,
                and they
                have largely avoided extreme weather conditions that can damage harvests. This, together with
                the
                plummeting pound that has seen prices of our imported wines shoot up, means wines from the east
                tend to
                offer really good value for money.</p>

            <h2 class="titles">The history of Hungarian wine</h2>
            <p>One hundred years ago, Hungary was one of the most important wine producers in Europe. Every
                royal
                court
                in Europe clinked glasses filled with precious gold Tokaji (“toe-kye”) wine, while other lush
                Hungarian
                whites and reds were lauded and enjoyed throughout Europe. So why don’t we see more Hungarian
                wine
                today?
                Cue the aggressive assault of phylloxera in the 1880’s, two world wars, and forty years of
                communist
                collectivization and we begin to get our answer.</p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, Hungary is bouncing back. Countless small estates, replanted and cultivated across
                the
                country are turning out beautiful wines–a result of traditional winemaking culture mixed with a
                modern
                sensibility. With 22 wine regions growing hundreds of varietals, many of which are indigenous
                and
                under
                protection, the country offers a multitude of great
                wines to explore. </p>
            <p>The country is located between the 46th and 49th parallel which is actually the same
                latitude range as many of France’s top wine regions from Northern Rhône to Champagne. Hungary’s
                rolling
                hills are rich in volcanic soils and limestone–idyllic soil types for fine winemaking.</p>

            <p>Fun fact: Nearly every single language’s word for wine derives from the latin word vinum. There
                are
                only
                three languages whose word for wine does not: Greek (oinos), Turkish (sarap), and Hungarian
                (bor).
                Some
                historians believe this might indicate an early Hungarian connection to winemaking unrelated to
                the
                Romans,
                feeding the strong suspicion that Hungarian wine culture predates most of the other wine
                cultures of
                Europe.

            <p>Hungarian wine is probably more than you expected, with wine regions and local styles that are as
                alluring as
                they are diverse. They are under-hyped, but are begging to become the next stars of the wine
                world.
                Opening a bottle of Hungarian wine is like uncovering a
                great historical secret. Luckily for us, the secret is out, and the history is just beginning.</p>
